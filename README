Hi! This is the Python code I run whenever I need to crunch
the numbers necessary to produce weekly tallies for themed
Art Fights, events that a friend and I host on occasion.

This is free to use and modify. The only thing to take note
of is that this particular piece of code expects a specific
.csv format when using `clean_csv()` so please be careful
and tweak it for your use.
